# City network pathfinding

website that visualizes a network of cities connected by roads and calculates the shortest path between locations using Dijkstra's algorithm. 

## Visual Map 

- A graphical representation of multiple cities as nodes on a map Roads connecting these cities with different distances/weights
- Clear visual distinction for cities and roads (appropriate icons and styling) with responsive design.

## Interactive Features

- Ability to select any city as a starting point
- Ability to select any city as a destination
- A "Calculate Route" button to initiate the pathfinding
- Clear visual highlighting of the shortest path once calculated
- Display of the total distance/time of the calculated route

## Algorithm Implementation

- implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
- Real-time calculation and display of results
- Option to view step-by-step execution of the algorithm (for educational purposes)
